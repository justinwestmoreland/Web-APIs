Make an HTML landing page with a container for quiz questions to pop up, like a slide show almost

Navbar with a timer or a timer somewhere on the page?

Upon clicking the start button, the timer starts and the first question pops up

After question is answered, correctly or not, another question appears. 

--If answered incorrectly, time is deducted from the clock

game ends when the timer gets to 0 OR all the questions are answered correctly 

after the game ends, I can put my initials in where my score is. I'm assuming the score is how many quesitons you got correctly in what amount of time.
